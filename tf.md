if the files in nonprod/ and prod/ are exactly the same, and I make a change in nonprod , I want the workflow to promote the exact same change in prod and make the change for me. How do I do that from the workflow?



Certainly! Here’s an example workflow using GitHub Actions to detect changes between environments using terraform plan and excluding specific files:

name: Check Terraform Environment Changes

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'nonprod/**'
      - 'prod/**'
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  check_changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Get Terraform modules
        run: terraform init

      - name: Create Terraform plan for nonprod
        id: plan_nonprod
        run: terraform plan -out nonprod.tfplan nonprod/

      - name: Create Terraform plan for prod
        id: plan_prod
        run: terraform plan -out prod.tfplan prod/

      - name: Get changed resources
        id: diff_changes
        run: |
          terraform show -json nonprod.tfplan > nonprod.json
          terraform show -json prod.tfplan > prod.json
          jq -s '.[0] - .[1]' nonprod.json prod.json > diff.json

      - name: Check for differences and exclude files
        run: |
          jq 'del(.resource_changes[] | select(.change.actions == ["no-op"]))' diff.json > filtered_diff.json
          cat filtered_diff.json

      - name: Label PR if there are differences
        if: steps.check_changes.outputs.filtered_diff != '[]'
        uses: actions/github-script@v4
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            github.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: 'There are changes between nonprod and prod environments.'
            })

This workflow:

	1.	Triggers on pull request opening or when changes occur within the nonprod or prod directories.
	2.	Uses the hashicorp/setup-terraform action to set up Terraform.
	3.	Generates Terraform plans for both nonprod and prod environments.
	4.	Compares the plans using terraform show -json and jq to filter out differences, excluding no-op changes.
	5.	If there are differences, it adds a comment to the pull request using GitHub Actions’ github-script.

You might need to adjust paths or commands according to your specific directory structure and Terraform setup. This workflow should give you a starting point to detect changes between your environments and label the PR accordingly.

Using diff is a decent approach, but for structured comparison and handling exclusions, you might want to consider using tools like terraform plan or a dedicated diffing tool that allows for file exclusions.

To ignore specific files during the diff process, you can use the --exclude flag with diff. For instance, the command might look like this:

diff -rq --exclude='backend.enc.hcl' --exclude='config.auto.tfvars.json' --exclude='secrets.auto.tfvars.enc.json' nonprod/ prod/

This command compares the content of the nonprod and prod directories recursively while excluding the specified files from the comparison. You can incorporate this command into your GitHub Actions workflow to check for differences.

However, for Terraform-specific comparisons, utilizing terraform plan might be more precise as it analyzes the changes based on the Terraform configuration rather than raw file differences. You can redirect the terraform plan output to a file, exclude the files you don’t want to include, and then perform a diff between the generated plan files for the environments.

Would you like an example of how to set up this workflow using terraform plan and handling exclusions?




Got it! You can organize your Terraform code into folders for each environment (e.g., env/nonprod and env/prod). Then, within your GitHub Actions workflow, you can use conditionals or separate job steps to target the appropriate environment based on the changes made.

For instance, you might use conditional statements in your workflow YAML file to determine which folder to apply changes from based on the triggered event or committed files. Once identified, you'd run Terraform commands within the corresponding folder to apply changes specifically to that environment.

Remember to manage your state files accordingly to ensure each environment has its own state file for isolation and manageability.

Yes, in Terraform, versioning modules is a common practice. For environment promotion, you can consider using separate branches or tags for each environment (e.g., nonprod and prod). With GitHub Actions, you can trigger different workflows based on branch or tag names. For instance, upon merging changes to the nonprod branch, trigger a workflow to apply changes to the nonprod environment. Similarly, merging to the prod branch or tagging a commit could trigger a workflow to apply changes to the prod environment. This allows controlled promotion of changes through your environments.

Certainly! For publishing Terraform modules and setting it up with a folder structure, you can start with the official Terraform documentation and other online resources:

1. **Terraform Registry Documentation:** The Terraform Registry is the primary place for discovering and sharing Terraform modules. The official documentation on publishing modules will guide you through the process.
   
2. **Folder Structure and Module Composition:** While there might not be specific documentation on folder-based module organization, understanding module composition and structuring your code in a modular way within folders for different environments can be found in Terraform's documentation on module creation and structuring.

3. **Terraform Module Registry Providers:** Explore specific documentation for module registry providers you plan to use, such as Terraform Registry, GitHub Packages, or other private registries. Each provider may have its own guidelines for publishing modules.

4. **Community Blogs and Tutorials:** Often, community-generated content offers practical examples and insights into real-world usage. Search for blogs, tutorials, or GitHub repositories that demonstrate module publication with a folder-based structure.

5. **GitHub Actions Workflows:** Review GitHub Actions documentation for creating workflows that tag commits, create releases, and publish artifacts. You'll need this to automate the module publication process.

By combining these resources and understanding how modules are structured and published, you can create a system that aligns with your folder-based structure for different environments while publishing modules appropriately.
